Retro DVD screensaver ðŸ“€
After re-watching The Office for the nth time, I decided to recreate this piece of pop culture classic as my first JavaScript project.

Short history:

The bouncing DVD logo was introduced by the international organization DVD Forum and DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation, a Tokyo-based international company established in the year 2000 with the purpose of standardizing the DVD format.

While it could be found in any home with a DVD player, it definitely gained notoriety when it became the subject of a popular cold open on the American mockumentary sitcom TV series, The Office, episode "Launch Party".

Features of the bouncing DVD logo:
Responsive scaling when the window is resized
The DVD logo is an SVG asset that:
changes to a random color as it hits the edge of the window
starts blinking as it hits the window corner
Custom sound effects for hitting the edge of the window and when hitting the window corner
